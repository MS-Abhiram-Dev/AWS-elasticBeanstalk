# README for Jenkins Code Pipeline to Deploy to AWS Elastic Beanstalk

This README provides instructions and details about a Jenkins pipeline that automates the process of building and deploying a Java application to AWS Elastic Beanstalk.

## Overview

This Jenkins pipeline consists of several stages:
1. **Checkout**: Retrieves the source code from a specified Git repository.
2. **Build**: Compiles the application and packages it.
3. **Deploy to Elastic Beanstalk**: Zips the application and deploys it to an AWS Elastic Beanstalk environment.

## Prerequisites

Before using this pipeline, ensure you have the following:

- Jenkins installed with necessary plugins (Pipeline, Git, AWS Steps).
- AWS CLI installed on your Jenkins agent.
- AWS credentials configured in Jenkins (AWS Access Key ID and Secret Access Key).
- An existing Elastic Beanstalk application and environment.

## Pipeline Configuration

### Environment Variables

The pipeline uses the following environment variables:

- `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`: Jenkins credentials ID for your AWS Access Key ID.
- `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`: Jenkins credentials ID for your AWS Secret Access Key.
- `AWS_REGION`: The AWS region where your Elastic Beanstalk application is hosted (e.g., `us-west-2`).
- `APP_NAME`: The name of your Elastic Beanstalk application.
- `ENV_NAME`: The name of your Elastic Beanstalk environment.

### Pipeline Stages

#### 1. Checkout

- **Action**: Checks out the code from a Git repository.
- **Command**:
  ```groovy
  git 'https://github.com/your-repo/your-project.git'
  ```

#### 2. Build

- **Action**: Runs the build command (Maven in this case).
- **Command**:
  ```groovy
  sh 'mvn clean package'  // Adjust this command based on your project
  ```

#### 3. Deploy to Elastic Beanstalk

- **Action**: Zips the application and deploys it to AWS Elastic Beanstalk.
- **Commands**:
  ```groovy
  sh 'zip -r app.zip target/*.jar'  // Adjust the path based on your output

  sh """
  aws configure set aws_access_key_id ${AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID}
  aws configure set aws_secret_access_key ${AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY}
  aws configure set region ${AWS_REGION}
  
  # Create or update the application version
  aws elasticbeanstalk create-application-version --application $APP_NAME --version-label v1 --source-bundle S3Bucket=my-bucket,S3Key=app.zip --description "Version 1"
  
  # Update the environment to deploy the new version
  aws elasticbeanstalk update-environment --environment-name $ENV_NAME --version-label v1
  """
  ```

### Post-Build Actions

The pipeline includes post-build actions to handle success and failure scenarios:

- **On Success**:
  ```groovy
  echo 'Deployment succeeded!'
  ```

- **On Failure**:
  ```groovy
  echo 'Deployment failed.'
  ```

## Running the Pipeline

1. Create a new pipeline job in Jenkins.
2. Copy and paste the provided Jenkins pipeline code into the job configuration.
3. Adjust the Git repository URL, application name, environment name, and build command as needed.
4. Save the job and trigger the build.

## Notes

- Ensure that the AWS CLI has the necessary permissions to interact with Elastic Beanstalk.
- Modify the version label and bucket details in the deployment stage according to your needs.
- This pipeline is a basic example. For production usage, consider implementing additional error handling and notifications.
